In this video, we will present packages of Python that will be used for this course. Pandas is a python package, providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building blocks, for doing practical real-world data analysis. For example, DataFrame and the series from Pandas, are excellent data structures to store table and time series data. With DataFrame, we can easily pre-process data. For example, handling missing value, computing pairwise correlation. We will heavily use DataFrame in this course. NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computing of array and matrix. It is also very convenient tool for generating random numbers, which could be helpful if we want to shuffle data, or generate a dataset with normal distribution. Matplotlib is a plotting package, which produces high-quality figures with all kinds of customization. Statsmodels is a powerful library for statistician. It contains modules for regression and time series analysis. In this course, we will use Statsmodels to obtain multiple linear regression models.
