The value of big data has been widely recognized in every field of business practice, especially in finance industry, because we have the largest data in this field. We have fast-growing of customer data in consumer banks, not to mention that tons of data are generated every moment in offline and online exchanges. Questions also arise about how to utilize this data. Data in financial market is different from those in other fields. They are usually non-stationary and have a high level of noises. Many successful statistical models do not work for this data. Model evaluation is much more important than model building. A statistically successful model is not necessarily successful in terms of profits. In this topic, we will explore the most often used prediction method, multiple linear regression. We will demonstrate how to apply this simple model to achieve success in application - trading stocks. We have five videos to explore this practical topic. We will first introduce association of a random variable and extended to simple linear regression in a second video to make predict Then we present assumptions for linear regression models and demonstrate how to validate these assumptions. In the fourth video, we extend simple linear regression model to multiple linear regression model by allowing more than one predictors. Finally, we apply the model we achieved in trading, most popular ETF - SPY. We will focus on the consistency of performance of models, and how to evaluate correctly. We expect that after this topic, you are able to build your own prediction models. It is great fun to test the performance of your own model using historic data.
